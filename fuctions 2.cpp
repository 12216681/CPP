/*Define a class named GroceryItem. Include private fields that hold an item�s stock 
 number, price, quantity in stock, and total value. Write a public function named 
 dataEntry()that calls four private functions. Three of the private functions prompt 
 the user for keyboard input for a value for one of the data fields stock number, price, 
 and quantity in stock. The function that sets the stock number requires the user to 
 enter a value between 1000 and 9999 inclusive; continue to prompt the user until a 
 valid stock number is entered. The functions that set the price and quantity in stock 
 require non-negative values; continue to prompt the user until valid values are entered. 
 Include a fourth private function that calculates the GroceryItem�s total value field 
 (price times quantity in stock). Write a public function that displays a GroceryItem�s 
 values. Finally, write a main()function that declares a GroceryItem object, assigns 
 values to its fields, and uses the display function. Save the file as Grocery.cpp.*/
